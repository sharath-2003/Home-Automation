# Home-Automation(THE DETAILED REPORT IN THE ABOVE PDF)
Mini Project on Home Automation

∗ Built a Home Automation system using Arduino with Bluetooth connection controlled by Android Device.

∗ Has been built using the Arduino UNO, microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P, which is taken input using a
HC-05 Bluetooth module and given output using a 4-channel relay module thereby supplied to different electronics
appliances.The microcontroller has been programmed using Arduino IDE.

∗ A User-friendly interface has been designed to control the setup remotely using the MIT App Inventor ,which be used on
any android device.

∗ In addition to the project given, for better experience Voice-controlling feature is also been added.
